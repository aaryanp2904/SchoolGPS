# SchoolGPS

This was a short project I did in Year 13 to deepen my understanding of Dijkstra's algorithm and put to use my knowledge of representing graphs in code.

In the Graphs folder you can see the graph that I drew to represent the map of the school. This has then been represented in my program as an adjacency list. The program takes the nameof the node you are currently at and the name of the node you wish to visit then calculates the shortest path.
